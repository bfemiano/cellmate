Cellmate

Framework to help abstract columnar data collection and manipulation from the details specific to that API.  

Users manipulate data as collections of 'cells' decoupled from the underlying datastore API. 

This project is not yet ready to be forked or used. Sorry to get anyones hopes up (if by some miracle you found this already)
It's about 2-3 weeks away from where I want it with regards to functionality and testing.
