Cellmate

This framework is designed to help abstract columnar data collection and manipulation
from the API-specific persistence operations. 

Users manipulate data as collections of 'cells' decoupled from the underlying datastore API. Currently the only usage examples are checked into my other repository titled gowalla-persistence-and-ingest.

This project is not yet ready to be forked or used. Sorry to get anyones hopes up (if by some miracle you found this already)
It's about 2-3 weeks away from where I want it with regards to functionality and testing.
