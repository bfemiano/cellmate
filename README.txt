Cellmate

This framework offers a collection of interfaces and concrete helper implementations to
abstract data collection and from the API-specific persistence operations. 

Users manipulate data as collections of 'cells' decoupled from the underlying details
behind how they are written/read from any datastore. Currently the only implementation
of said classes are in Cloudbase 1.3.4 checked into my other repository titled gowalla-persistence-and-ingest.

This project is not yet ready to be forked or used. Sorry to get anyones hopes up. 
It's about 2-3 weeks away from where I want it with regards to functionality and testing.
